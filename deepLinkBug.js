This error occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links, particularly when the app isn't yet fully initialized.  It can manifest as an unhandled promise rejection, often without a clear error message, or a silent failure where the deep link simply doesn't trigger the expected action. This is frequently observed when the app is launched directly from a deep link, before the `App` component has fully mounted and initialized necessary listeners or state.
